# Python Input and Data Structure Practice Tasks

This project contains five beginner-friendly Python programs focused on user input and working with common data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and list comprehensions.

---

## ✅ Task List

### 1. Create a List of Integers and Compute the Sum
- Accepts user input of integers separated by spaces.
- Stores them in a list.
- Computes and displays the total sum.

### 2. Tuple of Favorite Books
- Creates a tuple of five favorite books.
- Uses a `for` loop to print each book title on a separate line.

### 3. Dictionary for Person's Information
- Asks the user to input their name, age, and favorite color.
- Stores this information in a dictionary.
- Prints the dictionary contents.

### 4. Find Common Elements in Two Sets
- Accepts user input to create two sets of integers.
- Finds and prints the common elements shared between them.

### 5. List of Words with Odd Character Lengths
- Defines a list of words.
- Uses list comprehension to filter and return only words with an odd number of characters.
